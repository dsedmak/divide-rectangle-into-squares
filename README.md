# Assignment

Let's say you have an empty web page open in your web browser. The width and height of your web browser window can vary. Calculate the biggest square you can fit on the page (position, edge length). Then calculate the next biggest square you can fit without overlapping any other squares that are already on the page. Keep doing this until there is no room left on the page and you have calculated all the squares you can fit on it. Write at least a few tests that verify your code works.

## Usage

 ```bash
 npm i
 npm test
 npm start
 ```
